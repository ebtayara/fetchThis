Push to Heroku:

git push heroku

If you ever need to roll back, DO NOT DROP YOUR DATABASE! Instead, migrate down and up:

heroku run npx sequelize-cli db:seed:undo:all
heroku run npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo:all
heroku run npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
heroku run npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all

If undoing the migrations and seeds don't work, you can reset the entire database by
removing and adding the Heroku Postgres add-on that you added in the beginning of Step 2.
Then migrate and seed again.
